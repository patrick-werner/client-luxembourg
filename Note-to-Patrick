Hi Patrick,

We met at the HL7 conference in Nevada two weeks ago. I work with Melissa and took a picture of your badge, but didnt find an e-mail address. Maybe this will work. 

Without too public a display of my own address, if you take my username on github and put a period betwen the names, and guess where the @ sign goes, a message should reach me.
